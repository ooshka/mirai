# Backlog

## Next 3 Candidate Slices

1. Retrieval Query Contract (selected)
- Value: provides the first retrieval API contract over deterministic chunk data so runtime agent workflows can consume ranked results.
- Size: ~1 day.

2. Index Artifact Persistence Contract (local snapshot only)
- Value: reduces repeated full-note scans by introducing a simple persisted index artifact contract without external storage dependency.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.

3. Patch Policy Hardening (extended diff edge cases)
- Value: hardens mutation safety for unusual hunks/context shapes and reduces patch-apply regressions before expanding mutation operations.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.
