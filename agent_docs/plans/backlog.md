# Backlog

## Next 3 Candidate Slices

1. Patch Parser Boundary Extraction (selected)
- Value: reduces patch-mutation fragility by separating diff syntax parsing from safety policy logic.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.

2. Semantic Retrieval Provider Seam
- Value: prepares embedding/vector integration behind provider boundaries without changing MCP query contract.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.

3. Route Composition Modularization
- Value: prevents `app.rb` from becoming a route orchestration bottleneck as MCP endpoints continue to grow.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.
