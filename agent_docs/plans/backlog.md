# Backlog

## Next 3 Candidate Slices

1. Semantic Retrieval Runtime Integration (selected)

- Active case: `agent_docs/cases/CASE_semantic_retrieval_runtime_integration.md`
- Size: ~1-2 days.

2. Shared Route Helper Boundary Cleanup
- Value: prevents helper-scope drift as modular route files grow, without changing endpoint contracts.
- Size: ~0.5 day.

3. Runtime-Agent Policy Mode Hardening Follow-up
- Value: tightens operator/deployment ergonomics around policy mode config while preserving current deny semantics.
- Size: ~0.5 day.
