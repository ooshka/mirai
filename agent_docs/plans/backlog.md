## Next 3 Candidate Slices

1. Index Lifecycle Controls (selected)
- Value: reduces stale-artifact ambiguity by making index freshness and operator controls explicit.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.

2. Patch Parser Extraction (if grammar expansion continues)
- Value: contains diff-format complexity by separating syntax parsing from policy validation before parser growth becomes fragile.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.

3. Semantic Retrieval Provider Seam (post-lifecycle controls)
- Value: prepares embedding/vector integration behind provider boundaries without changing MCP query contract.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.
