## Next 3 Candidate Slices

1. Patch Policy Hardening (edge-case diffs) (selected)
- Value: hardens runtime mutation safety by making unified-diff edge behavior explicit and test-backed.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.

2. Retrieval Scoring Strategy Seam
- Value: isolates ranking policy before semantic retrieval work to prevent monolithic retriever complexity.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.

3. Index Lifecycle Controls (manual invalidate + status)
- Value: reduces stale-artifact ambiguity by making index freshness and operator controls explicit.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.
