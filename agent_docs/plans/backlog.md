# Backlog

## Next 3 Candidate Slices

1. Index Lifecycle + Scale Controls (selected)
- Value: improves lifecycle ergonomics and prepares for growth now that freshness and invalidation signals exist.
- Active case: `agent_docs/cases/CASE_index_lifecycle_scale_controls.md`
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.

2. Local Smoke Script + Test-Flow Integration
- Value: creates a repeatable end-to-end validation path for local development and future EC2 staging.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.

3. Route Composition Modularization
- Value: prevents `app.rb` from becoming a route orchestration bottleneck as MCP endpoints continue to grow.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.
