## Next 3 Candidate Slices

1. Index Artifact Persistence Contract (selected)
- Value: persists deterministic chunk/index output locally so query paths can avoid repeated full-note scans.
- Size: ~1 day.

2. Patch Policy Hardening (extended diff edge cases)
- Value: hardens mutation safety for unusual hunks/context shapes and reduces patch-apply regressions before broadening mutation operations.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.

3. Retrieval Scoring Strategy Seam
- Value: prevents monolithic retriever complexity by isolating scoring policy before semantic retrieval integration.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.
