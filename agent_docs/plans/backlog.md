# Backlog

## Next 3 Candidate Slices

1. Deterministic Indexing Foundation (selected)
- Value: unlocks retrieval work by introducing deterministic note chunking and index rebuild contracts without provider coupling.
- Size: ~1-2 days.

2. Retrieval Query Contract (index-read endpoint with deterministic scoring stub)
- Value: provides the first retrieval API contract on top of indexing primitives, reducing integration risk with runtime agent workflows.
- Size: ~1 day.

3. Patch Policy Hardening (extended diff edge cases)
- Value: hardens mutation safety for unusual hunks/context shapes and reduces patch-apply regressions before expanding mutation operations.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.
