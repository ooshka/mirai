# Backlog

## Next 3 Candidate Slices

1. Patch Proposal Validation + Apply Endpoint (selected)
- Value: unlocks constrained, auditable note mutation via validated diffs instead of raw writes.
- Size: ~1-2 days.

2. Git Commit Wrapper + Mutation Audit Metadata
- Value: guarantees reversibility and traceability for every accepted patch mutation.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.

3. Patch Policy Hardening (multi-hunk edge cases + deterministic conflict contract)
- Value: reduces malformed diff risk and keeps patch behavior stable as patch complexity grows.
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.
