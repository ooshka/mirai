## Next 3 Candidate Slices

1. Runtime-Agent Action Policy Layer (selected)
- Value: introduces an explicit, testable safety seam that can deny runtime-agent mutations without route-level condition sprawl.
- Active case: `agent_docs/cases/CASE_runtime_agent_action_policy_layer.md`
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.

2. Semantic Retrieval Runtime Integration
- Value: upgrades retrieval quality by wiring provider-backed retrieval behind existing `/mcp/index/query` contract.
- Size: ~1-2 days.

3. Shared Route Helper Boundary Cleanup
- Value: prevents helper-scope drift as modular route files grow, without changing endpoint contracts.
- Size: ~0.5 day.
