## Next 3 Candidate Slices

1. Retrieval Storage/Lifecycle Hardening - Artifact Telemetry (selected)
- Value: adds deterministic storage telemetry so operators can make scale-aware rebuild/lifecycle decisions.
- Active case: `agent_docs/cases/CASE_retrieval_storage_lifecycle_hardening_artifact_telemetry.md`
- Size: ~0.5-1 day.

2. Runtime-Agent Policy Identity Extension Seam
- Value: prepares policy architecture for future identity-aware controls without broad auth scope.
- Size: ~1 day.

3. Retrieval Storage Lifecycle Controls (Phase 2)
- Value: introduces bounded retention/cleanup controls after telemetry baseline is in place.
- Size: ~1-2 days.
