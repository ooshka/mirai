# Current Sprint

## Active Case
- `agent_docs/cases/CASE_patch_policy_hardening_edge_diffs.md`

## Sprint Goal
Harden patch mutation contracts for edge-case unified diffs:
- define explicit accept/reject behavior for common diff edge markers
- preserve deterministic MCP error mapping for unsupported shapes
- reduce mutation-path regressions before expanding patch capabilities
