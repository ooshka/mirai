No active case.

## Sprint Goal
Harden retrieval storage lifecycle observability as note volume scales:
- add deterministic index artifact telemetry to `index/status` for storage-aware rebuild operations
- keep retrieval/query endpoint contracts stable while expanding status-only diagnostics
- preserve current artifact validation and error mapping behavior
