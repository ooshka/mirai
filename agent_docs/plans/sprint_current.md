No active case.

## Sprint Goal
Establish explicit index lifecycle controls before semantic retrieval expansion:
- expose deterministic index status metadata
- support safe manual invalidation of persisted index artifacts
- keep existing rebuild/query contracts stable while making lifecycle state observable
