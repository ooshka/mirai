# Current Sprint

## Active Case
- `agent_docs/cases/CASE_deterministic_indexing_foundation.md`

## Sprint Goal
Start retrieval-path delivery with deterministic local indexing primitives:
- introduce service-level deterministic chunking/index summary behavior
- expose MCP index rebuild contract with stable response shape
- keep provider/vector-store coupling out of this slice
