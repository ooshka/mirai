# Current Sprint

## Active Case
`agent_docs/cases/CASE_route_wiring_module_extraction.md`

## Sprint Goal
Keep API delivery sustainable as MCP surface grows:
- reduce route-layer coupling by modularizing Sinatra route wiring
- preserve existing MCP contracts while changing composition only
- maintain explicit, testable boundaries between HTTP wiring and service actions
