# Current Sprint

## Active Case
- `agent_docs/cases/CASE_mcp_route_orchestration_hardening.md`

## Sprint Goal
Stabilize endpoint architecture before adding new MCP capabilities:
- extract MCP route orchestration from `app.rb` into focused units
- centralize exception-to-error mapping for consistent API contracts
- preserve current read/patch endpoint behavior with test-backed parity
