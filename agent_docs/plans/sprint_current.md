No active case.

## Sprint Goal
Harden patch mutation contracts for edge-case unified diffs:
- define explicit accept/reject behavior for common diff edge markers
- preserve deterministic MCP error mapping for unsupported shapes
- reduce mutation-path regressions before expanding patch capabilities
