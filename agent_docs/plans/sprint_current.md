## Active Case
No active case.

## Sprint Goal
Establish a parser/validator boundary for patch handling before any grammar growth:
- extract unified-diff syntax parsing into a dedicated service
- keep validator as policy owner for safety constraints and path rules
- preserve existing MCP patch endpoint contracts while reducing validator complexity
