# Current Sprint

## Active Case
`agent_docs/cases/CASE_patch_parser_boundary_extraction.md`

## Sprint Goal
Establish a parser/validator boundary for patch handling before any grammar growth:
- extract unified-diff syntax parsing into a dedicated service
- keep validator as policy owner for safety constraints and path rules
- preserve existing MCP patch endpoint contracts while reducing validator complexity
