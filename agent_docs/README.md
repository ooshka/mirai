# Agent Docs

Lightweight planning artifacts for incremental, agent-executable work.

## Structure
- `cases/`: executable case files
- `plans/backlog.md`: prioritized candidate slices
- `plans/roadmap.md`: short directional roadmap
- `plans/tech_debt_log.md`: structural debt and refactor signals
- `testing/README.md`: testing infrastructure and verification commands for agents
