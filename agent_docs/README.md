# Agent Docs

Lightweight planning artifacts for incremental, agent-executable work.

## Structure
- `backlog.md`: prioritized candidate slices
- `plans/roadmap.md`: short directional roadmap
- `plans/sprint_current.md`: current active slice
- `cases/`: executable case files
- `notes/tech_debt_log.md`: structural debt and refactor signals

## Usage
Pick the top item from `plans/sprint_current.md`, execute the linked Case, then update backlog/sprint/debt logs.
